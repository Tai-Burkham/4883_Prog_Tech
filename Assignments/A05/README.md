- LeetCode 67 - add binary, This is a binary representation-related problem. Although it differs slightly, the logic of working with non-standard binary systems overlaps.
- LeetCode 1365 - How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number deals with
- -comparisons and rankings between numbers.
- LeetCode 1523
-   Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range. The logic of finding and summing odd numbers between two boundaries is closely related.
- LeetCode 191
-   Number of 1 Bits, where the goal is to count the number of 1s in the binary form of a number.
- LeetCode 2 - Add Two Numbers, which also involves handling addition of large numbers, albeit represented differently.
- LeetCode 66 - Plus One could help students develop basic arithmetic and comparison skills.
- LeetCode 69 - Sqrt(x), as both involve math operations that require approximation techniques.
- LeetCode 50 - Pow(x, n), where you calculate powers of numbers.
- LeetCode 414 - Third Maximum Number, where the goal is to find the third maximum but can be adapted for second-largest as well.
- LeetCode 55 - Jump Game, where you calculate possible jumps based on conditions.
- LeetCode 1342: Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
-   Involves simple arithmetic calculations and iterative processes, similar to the physics problem.


LeetCode 794: Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State
This problem involves a mathematical sequence, much like UVa's problem where you work with dynamic sequences.
LeetCode 1281: Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits
While this is a straightforward subtraction problem, this LeetCode problem involves subtraction logic in a basic setting.
